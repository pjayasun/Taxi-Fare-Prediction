# Taxi-Fare-prediction


The data contains only the pickup date & time, the latitude & longitude (GPS coordinates) of the pickup and dropoff locations, and the number of passengers.
I used haversine formula calculates the distance on a sphere between two sets of GPS coordinates. I performed feature engineering on the timestamp and derived useful statistics.

* continuous vs. categorical values
* embeddings
* batch normalization
* dropout layers
